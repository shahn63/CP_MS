# CP_MS
Conformalized Outlier detection for Mass-sepctrometry data

# CPMS function calculates the conformal prediction set 
# and marginal conformal prediction intervals.
# samp.plot=T builds the plot of the conformality scores/MH distance across the samples
# and returns detected sample IDs.

# CPMS_band function builds the plot of the marginal conformality intervals over m/z values
# with a given detected samples which is selected from the CPMS function.
# It returns detected m/z value IDs.
